1. The Four Main Features of OOP:
Encapsulation: This is about keeping data safe by only allowing access through specific methods, kind of
like putting it in a “capsule.”
Inheritance: A subclass can inherit fields and methods from a superclass, which helps reuse code and create
a hierarchy.
Polymorphism: It allows the same action to work differently for different objects, mainly through method
overriding.
Abstraction: It focuses only on essential features, hiding unnecessary details.

2. Difference Between Overloading and Overriding:
Overloading: This means having the same method name but with different parameters in the same class.
It’s used for compile-time polymorphism.
Overriding: A subclass redefines a method from its superclass with the same name and parameters.
It’s used for runtime polymorphism, so the subclass behavior can take over.

3. super vs. this:
this: Refers to the current object instance, often used to access instance variables or methods in this class.
super: Refers to the parent class, and is used to call methods or constructors from the parent class.

4. Interface vs. Abstract Class:
Interface: Defines behaviors without giving implementations, so classes can implement multiple interfaces.
Abstract Class: Can have both abstract methods (no implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation),
but it only allows single inheritance.

5. What is Polymorphism, and How Does Java Achieve It?
Polymorphism: It’s when the same action shows different behavior in different objects. Java achieves this
by using method overriding, where a superclass reference points to a subclass object, and the subclass’s
version of the method is called.
